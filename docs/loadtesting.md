# Load Testing Performance Report â€“ Server Side

## Purpose

Load testing helps identify issues like system lag, slow page load times, or crashes when different levels of traffic are accessing the application during production rather than post-launch.

This report shows the results at the Server and Application Side and summarizes them with different actions to be taken before going to production.

## Load Test Plan Scope

The objectives for a typical application are:

* Check number of simoultaneous users on a given time.
