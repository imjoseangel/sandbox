# Women needed

It is a fact that **gender-diverse teams are more effective**. Research has shown that they produce more effective results, learning opportunities and task mastery.

Diverse teams can improve business in many different ways like

* **Innovation**, where diversity can bring different experiences, ideas and perspectives to the table
* **connection**.  An inclusive culture increases employee engagement and productivity and will impact directly to customer engagement.

There are many studies demonstrating that [Gender-Diverse Teams Perform Better](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/gender-diversity-successful-teams). I have a question:

**Why I can count with three hand finger my women colleagues in my 20 years of career working in Engineering?**

Let's count:

> * Rebeca
> * Maria
> * Eva
> * Laura
> * Nina
> * Marisa
> * Itziar
> * Cristina
> * Mercedes
> * Angela
