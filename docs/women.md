# Women needed

It is a fact that **gender-diverse teams are more effective**. Research has shown that they produce more effective results, learning opportunities, and task mastery.

Diverse teams can improve business in many different ways like:

* **Innovation**, where diversity can bring different experiences, ideas, and perspectives to the table
* **connection**.  An inclusive culture increases employee engagement and productivity and will impact directly customer engagement.

There are many studies demonstrating that [Gender-Diverse Teams Perform Better](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/gender-diversity-successful-teams).

**First Question**:

Why I can count with three hand fingers my women colleagues in my 20 years of career working in Engineering?

Let's count:

> * Rebeca
> * Maria
> * Eva
> * Laura
> * Nina
> * Marisa
> * Itziar
> * Cristina
> * Mercedes
> * Angela

Brian Uzzi says:

> **“The benefits of gender diversity are kind of hidden, and because they’re hidden, they’ve been underutilized.”**

**Second question**: Are women hidden?

I don't believe so. This [study](https://hbr.org/2011/06/defend-your-research-what-makes-a-team-smarter-more-women) findings relates:

*There’s little correlation between a group’s collective intelligence and the IQs of its members. But if a group includes more women, its collective intelligence rises.*

> **The Female Factor**
>
> The chart plots the collective intelligence scores of the 192 teams in the study against the percentage of women those teams contained. The red bars indicate the range of scores in the group of teams at each level, and the blue circles, the average. Teams with more women tended to fall above the average; teams with more men tended to fall below it.

**Final question**: Are we afraid of intelligent people, and therefore we are afraid of women?

I miss a team where I could learn more from diversity and more women in the same team. I miss your creativity, your intelligence and your ideas.
